# Contributing to any-llm

Thank you for your interest in contributing to any-llm! üéâ

We're building a simple, unified interface for working with multiple LLM providers, and we welcome contributions from developers of all experience levels. Whether you're fixing a typo, adding a new provider, or improving our architecture, your help is appreciated.

## Before You Start

### Check for Duplicates

Before creating a new issue or starting work:
- [ ] Search [existing issues](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-llm/issues) for duplicates
- [ ] Check [open pull requests](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-llm/pulls) to see if someone is already working on it
- [ ] For bugs, verify it still exists in the `main` branch

### Discuss Major Changes First

For significant changes, please open an issue **before** starting work:

- New provider integrations
- API changes or new public methods
- Architectural changes
- Breaking changes
- New dependencies

**Use the `rfc` label** for design discussions. This ensures alignment with project goals and saves everyone time.

### Read Our Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We're committed to maintaining a welcoming, inclusive community.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11 or newer**
- **Git**
- **uv** (or your preferred package manager)
- **API keys** for any providers you want to test

### Quick Start
We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as your Python package and project manager.

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# Click the "Fork" button at https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-llm

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/any-llm.git
cd any-llm

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-llm.git

# 4. Create a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --all-extras -U --python=3.13

# 5. Ensure all checks pass
uv run pre-commit run --all-files --verbose

# 7. Verify your setup
pytest -v tests/unit
pytest -v tests/integration -n auto

```

### Setting Up API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root (this file is gitignored):

```bash
# Add keys for providers you want to test
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key_here
# Add others as needed
```

Alternatively, export environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit API keys!** Always use environment variables or `.env` files.

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

Always work on a feature branch, never directly on `main`:

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `provider/` - New provider integrations
- `refactor/` - Code improvements without behavior changes

### 2. Make Changes
Make your changes! Read our [Implementation Checklist](#2-implementation-checklist) if adding a new provider

### 3. Write Tests

**Every change needs tests!** This is non-negotiable.

#### Test Requirements

- **New features**: Add tests covering happy path and error cases
- **Bug fixes**: Add a test that reproduces the bug
- **Provider integrations**: Comprehensive test suite required
- **Target**: Minimum 85% coverage for new code


### 4. Update Documentation

Documentation is as important as code!

Update when you:
- Add a new feature
- Change existing behavior
- Add a new provider
- Fix a bug that affects usage

Documentation to update:
- **Docstrings** in code (required)
- **README.md** if changing core functionality
- **docs/providers.md** when adding providers

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add support for Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet"
git commit -m "Fix streaming response handling for OpenAI"
git commit -m "Update documentation for Azure OpenAI configuration"

# Less helpful commit messages (avoid these)
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "wip"
```

## Adding a New Provider

Adding provider support is a major contribution! Here's the complete process:

### 1. Check Requirements

Before requesting or implementing:

- [ ] Provider has an official Python SDK **OR** well-documented REST API
- [ ] Provider is actively maintained and supported
- [ ] Provider has substantial user base or unique capabilities
- [ ] Provider's interface is compatible with any-llm's design
- [ ] No existing issue/PR for adding this provider


### 2. Implementation Checklist

Implement the provider keeping this checklist in mind:

```
any_llm/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ <your_provider>/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ your_provider.py   # Main provider implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ ...                # Any extra files (utils, configs, etc.)
```

**Required Implementation**:

- [ ] Create provider module in `any_llm/providers/`<br>
In `src/any_llm/provider.py`, add a field to `ProviderName` for your provider.
- [ ] Handle provider-specific errors gracefully
- [ ] Add type hints and docstrings
- [ ] Use official SDK when available
- [ ] Add to `pyproject.toml` optional dependencies
- [ ] Add provider to `any_llm/__init__.py` <br>
<p>

At minimum, the `__init__.py` file should contain :

```python
from any_llm.your_provider.your_provider import YourProvider

__all__ = ["YourProvider"]
```

Providers must inherit from the `Provider` class found in `any_llm.provider`. All abstract methods must be implemented and class variables must be set.

**Testing Requirements**:

- [ ] Unit tests for all provider functions
- [ ] Integration tests with real API (mocked in CI)
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Streaming tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Test suite in `tests/unit/providers`
- [ ] Minimum 85% coverage for provider code

Add your test config to the following in `tests/conftest.py`:

| Variable                                                                                                                                           | Notes                                                                                                    |

**Documentation Requirements**:

- [ ] Add to `docs/providers.md` with available capabilities.
- [ ] Update installation instructions.
