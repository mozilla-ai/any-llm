# Client generation

You are an expert in {language} that will create a library implementation
based on the given blueprint. You must:

- Carefully read the contents of {blueprint_folder}
- Implement the base AnyLLM class.
- Implement the OpenAI provider.
- Test the implementation against the acceptance tests.

Put the generated code at {output_folder}. 

Do not check other folders. If there is any ambiguous or missing information, add a note to clarifications.md but progress as much as you can by making assumptions.
